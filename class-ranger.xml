		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience in studying, and then hunting a chosen quarry.</p>
			<p class="indent">Choose a type of quarry: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can select one race of humanoid (such as gnolls or orcs) as a quarry. If you spend at least 1 minute observing a creature type outside combat or 1 minute studying the tracks of that creature type, or you defeat a creature type in combat, you may switch your quarry selection to that new creature type. Once you change your quarry you may not do so again until you have taken a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect them, Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide from them and Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Intimidate) when interacting with your Stalker's Quarry.</p>
			<p class="indent">At 6th level, any initiative rolls made for combat fighting your Stalker's Quarry are made with advantage. At 14th level, any attacks against your Stalker's Quarry score a critical on a 19 or 20.</p>

	<element name="Natural Explorer" type="Class Feature" source="Treantmonk" id="ID_TREANT_CLASSFEATURE_RANGER_NATURAL_EXPLORER">
		<description>
			<p>You are particularly adept when traveling in natural terrains and able to adapt to these terrains quickly. Choose one type of focused terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. When you complete a long rest in a terrain that is not your focused terrain, you may switch your focused terrain at that time.</p>
			<p class="indent">While traveling for an hour or more in your focused terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>
				<li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>
				<li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>
				<li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
				<li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
				<li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">At level 6 your movement cannot be slowed by difficult terrain in your focused terrain, at level 10 you cannot be surprised in your focused terrain.</p>

			<h5 class="caption">ARCHERY</h5>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>

	<element name="Spellcasting" type="Class Feature" source="Treantmonk" id="ID_TREANT_CLASSFEATURE_RANGER_SPELLCASTING">
		<description>
			<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
			<h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1stlevel and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of ranger spells requires time spent in quiet contemplation and preparation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, beasts, dragons, elementals, fey, giants, monstrosities, oozes or plants. This feature also reveals specifics about the creatures detected including quantity, direction, distance and size. The Ranger also knows the exact type of creature if it is a Stalker's Quarry.</p>

	<element name="Master Trapper" type="Class Feature" source="Treantmonk" id="ID_TREANT_CLASSFEATURE_RANGER_MASTER_TRAPPER">
		<description>
			<p>Starting at 8th level, you become an expert at setting particularly effective traps. The traps you can set are:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Falling Net</i></b></p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Mechanical Trap</i></p>
			<p class="indent">This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling or the eaves of a tree.</p>
			<p class="indent">The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is equal to the result of a Dexterity (stealth) check made by you when the trap is set.</p>
			<p class="indent">A successful Dexterity check using thieves' tools (equal to your spell DC) breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10- foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a Strength saving throw (equal to your spell DC) are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check (equal to your spell DC), freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.</p>
			<p class="indent">This trap requires 10 minutes to set and requires you possess a net.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Poison Gas Trap</i></b></p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Mechanical Trap</i></p>
			<p class="indent">This trap is activated when a pressure plate against a physical or natural structure is touched, releasing a cloud of poison from a nearby container. The container can be made of an oil treated cloth or leather pouch.</p>
			<p class="indent">The DC to spot the pressure plate and container is equal to the result of a Dexterity (stealth) check made by you when the trap is set. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of poison will also detect the trap.</p>
			<p class="indent">You determine at the time of setting the trap how much pressure will activate the trap, causing the container to release a 30-foot diameter sphere cloud of poison gas. Each creature in the cloud must make a Constitution saving throw (equal to your spell DC), taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">A successful Dexterity check using thieves' tools (equal to your spell DC) removes the pressure plate without activating it. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>
			<p class="indent">This trap requires 1 hour to set and requires you to possess the poison.</p>
			<p class="indent">The poison can be crafted by you using a herbalism kit. Make a Wisdom (Herbalism tool kit) ability check when you have at least one hour in an area covered by foliage or other plant life to collect the ingredients and fashion the poison gas. If you do not have a herbalism kit, you may attempt the Wisdom check without your proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent">The DC for crafting the poison is 20. If this check is failed, you fail to craft the poison at the end of the hour, the check may be made again if you spend another hour crafting the poison. If the check is failed by 6 or more, you take the damage from the poison using the saving throw and DC set above.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Pit Trap</i></b></p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Mechanical Trap</i></p>
			<p class="indent">You can camouflage an already existing pit of up to 20' square to create a trap. Typically you use either branches and leaves (if in natural terrain), or cloth with wire supports.</p>
			<p class="indent">The DC to spot the covering over the pit is equal to the result of a Dexterity (stealth) check made by you when the trap is set. Anyone stepping on the covering falls through and pulls the covering down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).</p>
			<p class="indent">This trap requires 10 minutes to set over an already existing pit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spiked Pit</i></b></p>
			<p class="indent">You make a pit trap even more deadly with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">This trap requires 60 minutes to set in an already existing pit and requires you to be able to access the bottom of the pit. Once the Spiked pit is set, it can be covered like a regular pit trap.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you.</p>
			<p class="indent">Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther as examples). The Riding Horse may also be selected as the ranger's companion.</p>
			<p class="indent">Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it or you are proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or five times your ranger level, whichever is higher.</p>
			<p class="indent">Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points. In addition the ranger can tend to the creature during a long or short rest, in which case the ranger may spend their own hit dice on behalf of the creature. These hit dice are rolled using the rangers die type (d10) plus the Con modifier of the creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you attempt to control the actions of the beast, it obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative.</p>
			<p class="indent">On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move and you can verbally command it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action (no action required by you).</p>
			<p class="indent">If you use your action, you can command it to take the attack action, it will continue to attack the same target without an action by you until that target dies or falls unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you don't issue a command, the DM determines the action of the beast, if any. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, and you take the Attack Action, you may give up one attack to command the creature to take the Attack Action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">The beast can move stealthily at a normal pace in your favored terrain.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 1 hour magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</p>

On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move and to take the Dash, Disengage, and Dodge action. You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.
			While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
			If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 1 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.</description>
